Block consists of:
    index
    timestamp
    transactions
    validator
    current_hash
    previous_hash

Node contains:
    wallet --> private key, public key, bcc coins, list of transactions of node
    state
    staking of every code

Transaction:
    sender_address
    receiver_address
    type_of_transaction --> send coins: contains amount of coins and public key (address) of reciever, signature with private key, charged an extra 3% fee
                            send message: contains string to send, public key of reciever, fee 1BCC per character of the string
    amount
    message
    nonce --> counter that increases by 1 for every outsourcing transaction, 
              to prevent replay attacks by maliscious nodes
    transaction_id
    signature

Proof of Stake:
    Every node stakes an amount of money from which the chance of it being the next validator
    is calculated by the (amount of money staked)/(total amount from all nodes)
    

Mine block steps:
1. Find validator
2. Validator validates block
3. Adds block to chain
4. Broadcasts block to others
5. Coins added to validator

Create transaction steps:
1. Node creates transaction
2. Signs transaction
3. Broadcasts transaction
4. Other nodes validate transaction
5. If all nodes validate it positively node adds it to block

Questions
When we mine_block how will we calculate the amount of coins to be given to the validator?
